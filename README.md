# Data-Analytics

This Capstone Project aimed at finding out the factors which affects the pricing of hotels in the Indian market. Majority of the hotels have common features like the amenities they provide but a few may have some aesthetic or scenic views or indigeneous facilities which make them more desirable and hence their hotel stay charges are more than the average price. 
This project uses the dataset of hotel room prices across 42 different cities in India (Cities42.csv). And based on the analysis, I have chosen 3 features which affect the prcing of hotel rooms - namely the rating, capacity and presence of swimming pool.
